# Rasterizer

## ðŸŽ¯ GOALS

- Learn modern rust programming
- Understand the basics of rasterization
- Develop a basic rasterizer that can render colored triangles, and hopefully import in OBJ files

## ðŸ—‚ LAYOUT

- I will do periodic updates at the end of each session to talk about what I learned, and what I'm working on.
- I plan to do weekly check-in's every Sunday, this will summarize what I learned, and what I'm working on for the whole week.

### ðŸ“… Day 0

This is just a small little summer project. I want to learn some rust programming, so I've decided to make a Rasterizer.
I plan to do weekly updates, and I'm deeming this "Day 0". This is mainly so I can be held accountable for working on this project,
and make it easier for me to start.

#### ðŸ”œ Next Week

Learn about the basics of rust. Set up a rust project, and get it compiling. Try and render something to the screen.
